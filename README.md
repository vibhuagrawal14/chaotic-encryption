# RGB encryption with chaotic maps

Six chaotic maps are used for encrypting RGB images in this algorithm:

1. Logistic Map
2. Chebyshev Map
3. Gaussian Map
4. Circle Map
5. Bernoulli Map
6. Sine Map

There are three main files in the project:

1. enc.m : This contains the original algorithm (with 2 chaotic maps)
2. newencrypt.m : This contains the modified algorithm modified algorithm for RGB images (with 6 chaotic maps)
3. decrypt.m : This is the decryption code for the modified algorithm

Please find the algorithm details in the PDF titled: Chaotic Dynamical Systems_final.pdf
