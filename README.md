# RGB encryption with chaotic maps

There are three files for the projet:
1. enc.m : This is the original algorithm
2. newencrypt.m : This is the modified algorithm for RGB images
3. decrypt.m : This is the decryption code for the modified algorithm

Please find the algorithm details in the PDF titled: Chaotic Dynamical Systems_final.pdf
